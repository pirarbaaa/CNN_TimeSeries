## Convolutional Neural Networks for Time series forecasting
I propose a Convolutional Neural Network model, normally used in image recognition, for the analysis and prediction of a historical series of prices. Through various steps the model achieves an average prediction error of 4.5%.

## Steps of the model:

1. Feature selection
2. Encoding
3. Labeling
4. Training
5. Evaluation
